# Sprint 3-4 Implementation Summary: Core Weather Features & Location Management

## Overview
Sprint 3-4 focused on implementing the core functionality of the WeatherQuick app, including location management and weather data integration. We successfully completed all planned tasks, delivering a fully functional weather application with location management and real-time weather data.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Location Services & Management

#### Location Detection and Search
- Implemented GPS-based current location detection with proper permission handling
- Created a location search feature using OpenWeatherMap's geocoding API
- Added reverse geocoding to convert coordinates to readable location names

#### Location Management
- Developed a comprehensive location management screen with the following features:
  - Add current location with one tap
  - Search and add locations by name
  - Reorder locations using drag-and-drop
  - Delete unwanted locations
  - Set a default location
  - Enforce location limits based on user tier (3 for free users)

#### Supabase Integration for Locations
- Created database functions for:
  - Fetching user locations
  - Adding new locations
  - Updating existing locations
  - Deleting locations
  - Setting default locations
  - Reordering locations
- Implemented real-time synchronization using Supabase
- Added a database function for batch operations on location positions

### 2. Weather Data Integration

#### Weather Service
- Created a comprehensive WeatherService class that:
  - Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API
  - Fetches current weather, hourly forecasts, and daily forecasts
  - Retrieves weather alerts for locations
  - Gets air quality data
  - Transforms API responses into app-friendly data structures
  - Handles different unit systems (metric/imperial)
  - Provides rich weather condition details

#### Weather UI Components
- Implemented a Weather Home Screen with:
  - Location selection carousel 
  - Current weather display with temperature, condition, and details
  - Hourly forecast horizontal scrolling list
  - 7-day forecast with high/low temperatures
  - Weather alert display for severe conditions

#### User Preferences
- Created a Settings screen with:
  - Unit preference selection (°C/°F)
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Notification preferences
  - User account information
  - App information
- Implemented unit conversion throughout the app

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- Used a service-based architecture to separate concerns:
  - LocationService for location-related operations
  - WeatherService for weather data operations
  - Supabase integration for persistent storage
  - Clean UI components with clear responsibilities

### Data Management
- Implemented efficient data fetching with proper error handling
- Created TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Added data caching mechanism for weather information
- Used React hooks for state management

### User Experience
- Created intuitive and responsive UI for all screens
- Added loading indicators to show when data is being fetched
- Implemented error handling with user-friendly messages
- Ensured data is always fresh with pull-to-refresh functionality

## Next Steps
The successful completion of Sprint 3-4 lays the groundwork for Sprint 5-6, which will focus on premium features and user experience enhancements. The core functionality is now in place, and future sprints will build upon this solid foundation.
